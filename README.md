# SocialClub Notification Blocker

English | [French](translations/FR/README.md) | [Romanian](translations/RO/README.md) | [Russian](translations/RU/README.md) | [Spanish](translations/ES/README.md)

**8th of March, 2022 UPDATE: Rockstar has patched the current spectator exploit.**

**I've made an announcement on [the future of SCBlocker](https://github.com/Speyedr/socialclub-notification-blocker/discussions/12).**

# [Download v0.1.1](https://github.com/Speyedr/socialclub-notification-blocker/releases/download/v0.1.1/SocialClubBlocker-0.1.1.zip)

## Usage
1. Download and extract (or build yourself). The direct download link to the latest compiled release is above this message.
2. Run `SCBlocker.exe` as Administrator.

    - Alternatively, if you have Python, you can run directly from the interpreter by executing `python main.py` in an elevated command prompt while at the repo directory.
      - If you use this method then no build is needed.
4. If the program is running and the network filter is **ON**, notifications should now be blocked and won't reach your client.
5. Use the keys on your keyboard to navigate the menu.

## Configuration
 - Automatically saves your settings at `settings.ini`. Don't touch it. If you do and the program crashes, delete the file, restart the program, and the program will revert to defaults.
 - If `LOG BLOCKED ACTIVITY` is **ON**, the program will log information about dropped packets in `debug.log`. If you want to watch the log in real-time, you can use something like [mTail](http://ophilipp.free.fr/op_tail.htm).

## Notices
 - This program does **not** modify the SocialClub Overlay, nor any game that runs with the SocialClub Overlay enabled. In theory, this means that this program does not violate Rockstar's Terms of Service.
 - This program does **not** contain any reverse-engineered code, nor any code that would violate Take-Two's IP or Copyright.
 - Creating this program did **not** require any decompilation nor decryption of any program or service provided by or related to Rockstar Games / Take-Two Interactive.

## Filters
 - This app provides three different filtering heuristics that all target different points in the chain of communication between your client and the SocialClub Overlay.
 - Filter #1 `DROP_INC_80` is the fastest and impacts performance the least but you may be flooded with notifications when the filter is turned off.
 - Filter #2 `DROP_CLIENT_POST` is enabled by default as the end result is probably what most users are looking for.
 - Filter #3 `DROP_LENGTHS` is the most complicated and still under development and therefore not recommended.

## Bugs / Issues
 - If you encounter a crash or otherwise application-breaking bug, please follow the instructions and [submit an issue here](https://github.com/Speyedr/socialclub-notification-blocker/issues/new/choose).

## Build Instructions
**NOTE:** If you are just looking for the download without building yourself, you need to go to [Releases](https://github.com/Speyedr/socialclub-notification-blocker/releases) instead. Or just click the "Download" link near the top of this page.
#### Windows

1) Install Python 3 (3.8+ recommended)

    - If this is your first and only Python install, enabling the check-box `Add Python to PATH` will make the next step easier.
2) Run the following commands in a command prompt:
```
:: Make sure to open the command prompt in / navigate to your local repo directory before running these commands.
C:\Users\Speyedr\socialclub-notification-blocker> pip install -r requirements.txt
:: If 'pip' is not recognised (i.e. it wasn't added to PATH) then you will need to provide the absolute path to pip.exe, e.g.
:: Make sure to check your exact install directory (your version number or bundle may be different)
:: C:\Users\Speyedr\socialclub-notification-blocker> "C:\Program Files\Python 3.8\Scripts\pip.exe" install -r requirements.txt
C:\Users\Speyedr\socialclub-notification-blocker> python setup.py build
:: Again, if python is not recognised then you will need to use the absolute path instead:
:: C:\Users\Speyedr\socialclub-notification-blocker> "C:\Program Files\Python 3.8\python.exe" setup.py build
```
